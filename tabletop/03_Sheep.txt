A tabletop game designed to simulate a gift economy. Give sheep to your rivals to encourage them to become your
ally and give you their entire flock. React to gifts from rivals. Be careful - act too friendly, and you will 
give away your entire flock; too rude, and the villagers will run you out of town, or your opponent will
take all of their sheep to the next village in a huff.

You need: 

	* a six-sided die, a coin to flip, or any other simple random number generator
	
	* numbered playing cards (or any other counters numbered 1-9, with 1 representing an angry face and 
		9 representing a friendly face). You need multiple sets of counters per player.
		
	* counters representing sheep (I used cards from Settlers of Cataan)
	
	* a way of representing the four seasons. Each season is associated with a special event:
	
		Summer: Flip a coin. If it comes up tails, remove one sheep from each flock.
		Autumn: All lambs become sheep and are added to their player's hand. Feasts can only be held in Autumn.
		Winter: Everyone has a -1 reaction to everyone else.
		Spring: New lambs are added face-down to each flock. They do not enter play until the following Autumn. 
			The number of new lambs will be your current flock x 1.5 (round down).

Setup:

	1. Decide on the number of rivals. There must be at least 1 NPC rival or at least 2 players.
	
		1a. Each NPC has a flock and a reaction to each active player
		1b. Each player has a flock and a reaction to each rival (player and NPC).
		1c. The village has a reaction to each player. The village is always an NPC.
		
	2. You need a set of counters from 1-9 for each "reaction". Every reaction begins at 5 (neutral).
	
	3. Everyone (except the village) begins with 4 sheep and no lambs in their flock. You may see how many sheep a 
		rival has at any point in the game.
	
	4. The game begins in Summer.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
WIN the game by removing all of your opponents. Players / NPCs leave the game when their reaction to an opponent is 
		5 points friendlier than that opponent's reaction to them.
	1. Rivals become allies and give you their entire flock if they have a reaction of 9 (friendliest) and 
		you have a reaction of 5 (neutral) or lower.
	2. Rivals take their flock with them in a huff if they have a reaction lower than 9 when they leave the game.
	
LOSE the game by:
	1. Running out of sheep.
	2. Letting the villager reaction reach 1 (angriest).
	3. Having a reaction to an opponent that is 5 points friendlier than their reaction to you (ie become their ally).

Gameplay:
	
	1. Follow the instructions on the season card. 
	
	2. The first player picks one rival and give them any number of sheep from their flock. If it is Autumn, you may hold a 
		feast by giving your gift to the village. Discard sheep given to the village.
		
		2a. Rivals will adjust their reactions according to the size of your gift.
		
			For NPCs:
				Giftee:			+1 for every sheep given
				Other rivals:	-1 for every 2 sheep given
				All rivals:		+1 if you give to the village, regardless of gift size
				
		2b. Villagers will react -2 if you do not give any gifts during your turn, and -1 if you react negatively to an 
			exchange between two other parties. They will react +1 for every sheep given during a feast.

	3. Each player / NPC will give one gift to a rival. If you receive a gift, adjust your reaction to that rival. 
		The village's reaction to you will adjust by (your reaction - the number of sheep given to you). You can
		always react to an opponent if it is their turn, even if you do not receive a gift. Keep in mind this may anger the 
		villagers. 
			
			For NPCs:
				1. If the NPC has 1-2 sheep, take no action.
				2. If it is Autumn, roll a die and give that many sheep to the feast.
				3. Otherwise, pick the rival with the lowest reaction to the NPC and give them a random number of sheep.
		
		
	4. Random event (optional game element): 
		Roll a six-sided die and take action according to the result. The village will react to your	
		decision (see the table). Discard sheep to sacrifice them. The number of sheep needed for the sacrifice is
		equal to the number of active players (not NPCs).
		All active players should decide together which action to take, and whose sheep to use.
		
			Roll	No reaction		Sacrifice
			----	-----------		---------
			1-2			-2				+0
			3-4			-2				+2
			5-6			+0				+2
			
	5. Turn to the next season and start the next round.
