A tabletop game designed to simulate a gift economy. Give sheep to your rivals to encourage them to become your
ally and give you their entire flock. React to gifts from rivals. Be careful - act too friendly, and you will 
give away your entire flock; too rude, and the villagers will run you out of town, or your opponent will
take all of their sheep to the next village in a huff.

You need: 

	* a six-sided die, a coin to flip, or any other simple random number generator
	
	* numbered playing cards (or any other counters numbered 1-9, with 1 representing an angry face and 
		9 representing a friendly face). You need multiple sets of counters per player.
		
	* counters representing sheep (I used cards from Settlers of Cataan)
	
	* a way of representing the four seasons. Each season is associated with a special event:
	
		Summer: Flip a coin. If it comes up tails, remove one sheep from each flock.
		Autumn: All lambs become sheep and are added to their player's hand. Feasts can only be held in Autumn.
		Winter: Everyone has a -1 reaction to everyone else.
		Spring: New lambs are added face-down to each flock. They do not enter play until the following Autumn. 
			The number of new lambs will be your current flock x 1.5 (round down).

Setup:

	1. Decide on the number of players. Recommended: 3 players
	
		1a. Each NPC has a flock and a reaction to each active player
		1b. Each player has a flock and a reaction to each rival (player and NPC).
		1c. The village has a reaction to each player. The village is always an NPC.
		
	2. You need a set of counters from 1-9 for each "reaction". Every reaction begins at 5 (neutral).
	
	3. Everyone (except the village) begins with 4 sheep and no lambs in their flock. You may see how many sheep a 
		rival has at any point in the game.
	
	4. The game begins in Summer.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
WIN the game by removing all of your opponents from the game. You can do this by befriending them, driving them off, or 
	allowing them to lose all their sheep.
		
	1. Rivals become allies and combine flocks if they both a reaction of 9 (friendliest).
		The new allies also decide whose reactions to use for the remainder of the game.
		You must all reactions from 1 player - no picking and choosing.
	2. A player leaves the game, and takes their flock with them, if their reaction is 5 friendlier than another
		player's.
	
LOSE the game by:
	1. Running out of sheep.
	2. Letting the villager reaction towards you reach 1 (angriest).
	3. Having an opponent who is 5 points angrier towards you than you are towards them.

Gameplay:
	
	1. Follow the instructions on the season card. 
	
	2. Player 1 picks one rival and give them any number of sheep from their flock. If it is Autumn, Player 1 may hold a 
		feast by giving your gift to the village. Discard any sheep given to the village.
		
		For NPCs:
				1. If the NPC has 1-2 sheep, take no action.
				2. If it is Autumn, roll a die and give that many sheep to the feast.
				3. Otherwise, pick the rival with the lowest reaction to the NPC and give them a random number of sheep.
	

	3. All other players have a chance to react to Player 1's gift. 
		The village's reaction to each player will adjust by (their reaction - the number of sheep given to them). You can
		always react to an opponent on their turn, even if you do not receive a gift. Keep in mind that pettiness angers the 
		villagers.
		
			For NPCs:
				Giftee:			+1 for every sheep given
				Other rivals:	-1 for every 2 sheep given
				All rivals:		+1 if you give to the village, regardless of gift size
				
			Villagers will react -2 if you do not give any gifts during your turn, and -1 if you react negatively to an 
			exchange between two other parties. They will react +1 for every sheep given during a feast.
			
	4. Each player / NPC will give one gift to a rival. 
		
	5. Random event (optional game element): 
		Roll a six-sided die and take action according to the result. The village will react to your	
		decision (see the table). Discard sheep to sacrifice them. The number of sheep needed for the sacrifice is
		equal to the number of active players (not NPCs).
		All active players should decide together which action to take, and whose sheep to use.
		If players cannot reach an agreement, final say goes to the player with the friendliest village reaction.
		
			Roll	No reaction		Sacrifice
			----	-----------		---------
			1-2			-2				+0
			3-4			-2				+2
			5-6			+0				+2
			
	6. Turn to the next season and start the next round.
