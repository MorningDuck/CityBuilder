The palace allows you to gain wealth and influence for your ruler. You need
both wealth and influence to govern your city effectively.

Wealth is measured in baskets of grain, silver cash or paper debits depending 
on the tech level of the city. Wealth is needed to purchase new buildings and 
pay wages. Gain wealth by imposing taxes on citizens.

Influence is leveraged using courtiers (to manage culture and technology),
advisors (to improve citizen happiness and manage infrastructure), the 
military (to improve respect from citizens and foreigners, and to protect the 
city), and diplomats (to manage relationships and trade with foreign cities).

Cities with low-level tech use livestock both measure wealth and 
determine cultural influence. You can have a military at any tech level.

Upgrading the palace allows you to hire more courtiers and advisors, entertain
more diplomats, and upgrade your city's currency. Palace upgrades are
buildings which must be placed adjacent or near the palace.
