Workshops are industrial builings where raw materials are turned 
into finished goods. Workshops can spend time getting their own
raw materials, or purchase them elsewhere. Specialized workshops
are more efficient.

Workshops produce goods by commission. If a workshop produces a
surplus, the workshop owner may become a merchant and sell the
excess goods. If a shop runs out of commissions, workers who
are Tinkerers may do research.

Citizens will automatically build workshops near raw resources 
and labor. You can build guildhouses to discourage workshop
owners from building near houses. Most workshops require
road or rail access to receive deliveries of raw materials.

Citizens may request subsidies for creating or maintaining
workshops.
